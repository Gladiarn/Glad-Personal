# Glad Frontend — Backend-Ready Architecture

One requirement governs every frontend build under this skill: **the frontend must be backend-ready by construction** — swapping mock data for a real API later touches one file, never the UI.

This skill is deliberately scoped to data architecture only. It has no opinion on visual style, layout, typography, or whether a hero uses a photo — that's the job of whatever design skill is active (`frontend-design`, `impeccable`, `web-design-guidelines`, or a future replacement). Keeping the boundary sharp means this skill stays useful regardless of which design skill you're pairing it with this month.

Most frontend work hardcodes strings/arrays straight into JSX by default. That's the specific failure mode this skill prevents: a component wired to hardcoded data has to be *rebuilt*, not *reconnected*, when the backend shows up — and design corners get cut during that rebuild far more often than during the first build.

## Why mock-first, not hardcoded

A hardcoded table (`<tr><td>Alice</td>...` written directly in JSX) works today and creates real work tomorrow: someone has to find every literal, understand what it was standing in for, and rebuild the data flow while also not breaking the layout. A mock-first component never has this problem, because the UI was never coupled to where the data came from — only to its shape.

## The pattern: repository interface, two implementations

This mirrors the Repository Pattern in `backend-patterns` — use the same vocabulary so frontend and backend stay consistent when the same person (or you) builds both.

1. **Define the data shape first**, as a type, before writing any UI:
   ```typescript
   interface Market {
     id: string
     name: string
     status: 'active' | 'closed'
     volume: number
   }
   ```

2. **Define a repository interface** — the contract the UI will always talk to, regardless of what's behind it:
   ```typescript
   interface MarketRepository {
     findAll(filters?: MarketFilters): Promise<Market[]>
     findById(id: string): Promise<Market | null>
   }
   ```

3. **Implement it twice.** Mock now, real later — same shape, same async contract, so swapping is a binding change, not a rewrite:
   ```typescript
   class MockMarketRepository implements MarketRepository {
     async findAll(filters?: MarketFilters): Promise<Market[]> {
       await simulateLatency() // see "Simulate reality" below
       return mockMarkets.filter(/* apply filters */)
     }
     async findById(id: string) {
       await simulateLatency()
       return mockMarkets.find(m => m.id === id) ?? null
     }
   }

   class ApiMarketRepository implements MarketRepository {
     async findAll(filters?: MarketFilters): Promise<Market[]> {
       const res = await fetch(`/api/markets?${toQuery(filters)}`)
       if (!res.ok) throw new ApiError(res.status, 'Failed to load markets')
       return res.json()
     }
     async findById(id: string) {
       const res = await fetch(`/api/markets/${id}`)
       if (res.status === 404) return null
       if (!res.ok) throw new ApiError(res.status, 'Failed to load market')
       return res.json()
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Bind one implementation in exactly one place** — an env flag, a config module, or dependency injection at the app root. Never let a component import `MockMarketRepository` or `ApiMarketRepository` directly.
   ```typescript
   export const marketRepository: MarketRepository =
     process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS === 'true'
       ? new MockMarketRepository()
       : new ApiMarketRepository()
   ```

5. **Components and hooks consume the interface, never the implementation:**
   ```typescript
   function useMarkets(filters?: MarketFilters) {
     const [markets, setMarkets] = useState<Market[]>([])
     const [state, setState] = useState<'loading' | 'ready' | 'error'>('loading')

     useEffect(() => {
       setState('loading')
       marketRepository.findAll(filters)
         .then(data => { setMarkets(data); setState('ready') })
         .catch(() => setState('error'))
     }, [JSON.stringify(filters)])

     return { markets, state }
   }
   ```
   The table component that renders `markets` never knows or cares whether they came from a mock array or a live fetch. When the backend ships, flip the env flag. Nothing above the repository boundary changes.

## Simulate reality in the mock layer

A mock that resolves instantly and never fails teaches the UI to assume APIs always do too — that assumption breaks in production. The mock implementation must:

- **Add latency** (150–600ms, randomized) so loading states actually get exercised and designed, not bolted on later.
- **Occasionally fail** (configurable rate, default off but easy to flip on) so error states are real UI, not an afterthought.
- **Return realistic volume and content** — not `"Item 1"`, `"Item 2"`. Use plausible names, varied string lengths, edge cases (empty state, one item, 200 items) so layout decisions are grounded in what real content actually looks like. Lorem-ipsum-driven layouts hide real layout problems — good mock data is this skill's contribution to whatever design skill is doing the actual visual work.

Every data-bound component must handle three states because of this: loading, error, and empty (zero results is not the same bug as "still loading"). If a component only handles the success case, it is not done.

## Never hardcode — checklist before calling UI work finished

- [ ] No array/object literal in a component file stands in for data that will come from a backend (mock data lives in a dedicated `mocks/` or `fixtures/` module, never inline in the component)
- [ ] Every dynamic list, table, or detail view reads from a hook/store backed by a repository, not an imported mock file directly
- [ ] Loading, error, and empty states are implemented and visually designed, not just `if (loading) return null`
- [ ] The mock repository implements the *same interface* the real one will — check this by asking "if I swapped the binding right now, would any component need to change?" The answer must be no.
- [ ] Config/copy that is genuinely static (labels, nav items, legal text) is fine to hardcode — this rule is about data that originates from a backend, not literally everything

## Design is out of scope, on purpose

This skill never decides visual style, hero treatment, color, typography, or layout, and never asks design-interview questions — that's entirely the active design skill's job (`frontend-design`, `impeccable`, `web-design-guidelines`, or whatever is installed at the time). The only place this skill touches "design" at all is indirectly: realistic mock content (not lorem ipsum) gives the design skill real material to work against, since actual data surfaces layout problems — text overflow, varying lengths, empty states — that placeholder text hides.

If a design skill and this skill are both active on the same build, they should compose cleanly: the design skill decides what things look like, this skill decides where their data comes from. Neither should need to know the other's internals.

## Anti-patterns

| Pattern | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| `<td>{"Alice"}</td>` hardcoded in JSX | Has to be found and rebuilt, not reconnected, when the backend arrives |
| Component imports `mockUsers` array directly | Couples UI to the mock; swapping to a real API means editing every component instead of one binding |
| Mock resolves synchronously, never errors | Loading/error states never get built, then ship broken when the real API is slow or fails |
| Lorem ipsum / `"Item 1"`, `"Item 2"` placeholder content | Hides real layout problems; produces designs that break on real content later |
| Repository interface skipped, `fetch()` called straight from mock mode with a hardcoded mock response inline | No real swap point exists — "temporary" mock logic ends up scattered through the codebase |
